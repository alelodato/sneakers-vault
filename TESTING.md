## ‚úÖ Automated Testing (Unit & Integration)

All automated tests are written using **Vitest** and **React Testing Library**.  
The main focus was to test critical pages/components for rendering, interactivity, conditional UI, and context behavior.

| Test Suite              | Description                                                              | Status |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| `HomePage.test.jsx`         | Verifies rendering of home sections, links, titles, and structure        | ‚úÖ Pass |
| `ProductCard.test.jsx`  | Tests image, title, wishlist interaction, and prices (with/without discount) | ‚úÖ Pass |
| `CartPage.test.jsx`         | Checks cart item rendering, buttons for quantity update/removal, total price | ‚úÖ Pass |
| `CheckoutPage.test.jsx`| Tests if an item is correctly added to the cart with price, quantity, size infos and also button to payment    | ‚úÖ Pass |

## üß™ Manual Testing
